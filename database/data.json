I was walking around and observing that many stalks are doing brisk business (probably due to a wet and rainy Saturday) until I spotted this lone stall - there was no one in queue. I observed that maybe one or 2 folks would walk up to the stall, take a look and walk off. I do not know why. I decided to go up to the Aunty and strike up a conversation with her. Aunty is very soft spoken. She manage this stall on her own most times and sometimes with ad hoc help. She gets up early to prepare the ingredients. She / her stall is not on any delivery platform / FB. She told me her business is so bad that she hardly makes any money. If not for the one month rental rebate from G, she hardly makes any money after deducting all the ingredients and supplies etc.",
